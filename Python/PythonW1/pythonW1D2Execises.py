# calculation = ((99 ** 3)*8)
# print (calculation)

# ------------------------------------

# Exercise 3 : What Is The Output ?
# Predict the output of the following code snippets:
# >>> 5 < 3 / prediction: false
# >>> 3 == 3 / prediction: true
# >>> 3 == "3" / prediction: SyntaxError  comment: Because "3" is a str
# >>> "3" > 3 / prediction: SyntaxError  comment: Because "3" is a str
# >>> "Hello" == "hello" / prediction: true

# Exercise 7 : Odd Or Even
# Instructions
# Write code that asks the user for a number and determines whether this number is odd or even.

# num = int(input("Enter the frist number"))
# if (num % 2) == 0 :

# userHeight=int(input("What is your size (in inch)?"))
# limitHeight = int(145/2.54)
# if userHeight > limitHeight:
#     print("you are tall enough to ride!")
# else:
#     print(f"you are {int(limitHeight*2.54)}cm! you are not tall enough to ride :(")
